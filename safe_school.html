                <h4>As a parent:</h4> In selecting a school for your child you may keep these point in mind.

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Visit the school along with your kid to experience and check the environment with reference to the above safety points.</li>
                    <li>
                        Check the validity of official reorganization of the school status. Recognition/permission from State or Central Govt., is a must.</li>

                    <li>Check if the school bus fulfills all the regulations laid by the Road Transport Authority of the region.</li>

                    <li>Note down the bus driver or bus service operator mobile numbers.</li>

                    <li>Interact with drivers and remind them of safe driving and orderliness.</li>

                    <li>Educate your kid to follow the attendant/driver instructions while traveling in the school bus.</li>

                    <p>
                        Children must be aware of preparedness for potential hazards of any kind that can affect any campus. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, and catastrophes, such as chemical spills, biological threats, are potential hazards that can affect any campus. We must be prepared for all of these, as well as man-made crises, which can come in the form of bomb threats, terrorism or violence on campus.

                    <li>Remain seated, facing forward the entire ride.</li>

                    <li>Never throw things in the bus or out of the windows.</li>

                    <li>Never play with the emergency exits.</li>

                    <li>Do not sneak out of the bus window.</li>

                    <li>Do not distract the driver’s attention.</li>

                    <li>If you have to cross the road after getting off the school bus , wait for the bus to go first.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Campus</h4>
