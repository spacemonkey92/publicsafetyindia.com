                            At SCAPS ( Society to Create Awareness on Public Safety) one of our objectives is to develop teaching material on safety education for children. The “Kids Safety Tips” book attached to this note is the first of such publications. The book attempts to create awareness in the child on the safety aspects to be considered in day to day interactions.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Our goal at SCAPS is to reach out to as many Government schools as possible with this publication. Teachers in the Schools would use the book to sensitize children on safety, which would be of lifelong benefit to them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On behalf of SCAPS , may I request your contribution to sponsor a specific number of books? Each book is priced at Rs 100. Cheques may be drawn in the name of “Society to Create Awareness on Public Safety ”.
